### The Plan:
One of the most difficult problems when developing Internet of Things solutions is provisioning the connected devices/sensors. Typically these devices need some network connectivity credentials (e.g. WIFI SSID & passphrase) and some credentials to authenticate against the backend cloud solution. The developer is left with a

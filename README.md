A proof of concept project used to explore the [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) stack for provisioning Raspberry Pi's as Bluetooth sensors, and a (simple!) KNN classifier to predict indoor positioning of iBeacons.

### The Plan:
One of the most difficult problems when developing Internet of Things solutions is provisioning the connected devices/sensors. Typically these devices need some network connectivity credentials (e.g. WIFI SSID & passphrase) and some credentials to authenticate against the backend cloud solution. Manually configuring a single device is OK, but when multiple devices are needed for a solution, this provisioning can be a blocker to progress. In addition, rapid development of concepts relies on a tight development-feedback loop. The [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) is a solution to both of these issues, and so I was keen to try it for myself!
In order to make sure I experienced the provisioning process fully, I wanted a problem to solve which required more than one device. I have also been looking for an opportunity to try and create an indoor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) locating system for some time having created more simple present/absent systems previously. And so the plan was hatched:
